As a Data Engineer, I focused on optimizing our big data workflows. I improved existing Spark jobs by fine-tuning queries and cluster configurations, which reduced Azure DBU costs by 20%. I also implemented custom Spark UDFs in Java for critical tasks like data decryption, DICOM image parsing, and converting data from FHIR to HL7 for ingestion into cloud EHRs, while also mentoring junior team members on best practices.
