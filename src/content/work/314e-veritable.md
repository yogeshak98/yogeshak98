As Engineering Lead, I architected a multi-tenant platform using Kubernetes CRDs and Operators in Java/Quarkus, which cut deployment time by 40%. I also designed a SaaS billing system with Lago, saving 3% in revenue, and led the development of AI-powered RAG features to summarize benefits and claim status, providing crucial time savings for healthcare administrators. My work on automating batch processing for eligibility and claims reduced API costs by 25%.
